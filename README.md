# Pac-Man: Deep Convolutional Q-Learning for Classic Arcade Play

This project demonstrates the application of Deep Convolutional Q-Learning (DQL) to train an AI agent to play the classic Pac-Man game. The goal is to develop an agent that can navigate the game environment, avoid ghosts, and eat all the pellets efficiently.

## Project Overview

- **Environment**: The Pac-Man environment from the Gymnasium library.
- **Algorithm**: Deep Convolutional Q-Learning (DQL), an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with convolutional neural networks.
- **Objective**: Train an agent to play Pac-Man by optimizing its actions through experience and exploration, ultimately mastering the game.

## Features

- Implementation of a Deep Convolutional Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay and target network.
- Visualization of training progress and agent's performance.
- Evaluation of the trained agent's ability to play Pac-Man in various scenarios.

## How to Run
**1. Access the Colab Notebook**: Open the Pac-Man Colab Notebook to view and run the project code directly in Google Colab.

**2. Run the Cells**: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to train the agent and visualize its performance.

**3. Evaluate the Agent**: After training, evaluate the agent's performance by running the evaluation cells in the notebook.
